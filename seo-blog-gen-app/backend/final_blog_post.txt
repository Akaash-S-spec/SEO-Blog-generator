It seems like there has been little movement toward a legislative update because of an apparent "welcoming" Trump-era "coup." The White House recently had a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, as did several of the most powerful Chinese members of Congress last week, including the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Yongkang, and President Xi Jinping of South Korea. The US, Russia, Germany and Japan have been in Beijing to meet with Trump officials and representatives since March to talk about the need for a deal. This is particularly noteworthy, given the nature of the situation on the Korean Peninsula today. There is a growing perception that the nuclear warhead that was reportedly seen floating a week ago was actually on an Israeli border. This could represent a way forward in terms of resolving the Korean Peninsula dispute from the beginning. Even President Trump has expressed skepticism about the possible use of such "kill switch" missiles, especially from Israel, for Proofread and improve: Affairs, Wang Yi. At the White House, U.S. Ambassador to China Robert Kelner had a "couple of meetings" with some top officials, including members of the Chinese Foreign Ministry. And there has always been a little discussion with China's foreign ministers about possible action in reaction to the latest developments.

But he went on to say in an open letter addressed to Xi that she is "very keen to work with the Chinese on issues affecting our community and people in our state-run enterprises." This isn't the first time China has been mentioned as a potential candidate but it's only just—that's all, right? Trump has criticized China's use of algorithms to produce fake news and Trump thinks Russia is plotting the next big Trump-Russia election. We've asked that information for several weeks, but this is the first time that China has been mentioned as a potential candidate. As we've written before, the New York Times picked up this story and reported that Russia had used Russian intelligence services in the 2016 election, and some of the attacks on WikiLeaks have been linked to the hacking of Democrats' party websites. So, if China's cyberattacks are indeed a threat to the U.S., we might be looking at someone who's interested more in protecting the US corporate media than in defeating climate change. The next big question here is that Trump and Xi are so close, and that they've already met in a few meetings. So the real question is who is "sucking up" to Trump?

The other four candidates could be interesting—they all meet in the next week or so. This might also include some companies that are already on Trump's radar. And Trump has made some nice headlines lately, with him suggesting a New Zealand company might be the most interesting possible next step, even though it does not have a building that would host the Oval Office. A recent Wall Street Journal op-ed by former Trump National Economic Council Director Peter B. Borowo put that kind of thought on the right track, stating that the "new-build, Trump-style, world-class tower would not only serve to make the United States more urban-looking but also to be a new standard in the building's history for how it will be used."

But what will then be the "new-build" phase of building on Trump's "New York, New York,
